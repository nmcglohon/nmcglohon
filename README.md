Hi! I'm Neil McGlohon

This is an auxillary account for long term storage of personal repositories that are cluttering my main account.

See https://github.com/nmcglo for my main account.

    💬 I am a research scientist at IBM Research in Almaden. While my team is based in the Bay Area, I work remotely from Troy, NY. I work on the brain-inspired computing team which provides me with interesting and unique challenges to learn from. I particularly enjoy my work as it allows me to utilize my main areas of expertise to push toward groundbreaking results and demonstrations of the effective use of dedicated AI hardware.

    🏫 I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science in the subfield of Parallel/High Performance Computing and a M.S. in the subfield of Distributed Computing for the purposes of machine learning. My dissertation was focused on the evaluation and analysis of congestion on supercomputer communication networks and methods of mitigation. This work was accomplished through years of research and development to create fine-grained yet massive-scale parallel simulation models to facilitate accurate predictive results of current and hypothetical supercomputer network designs.

    😅 99% of my activity is committed to IBM's self-hosted GitHub Enterprise server which does not report activity to public GitHub.
